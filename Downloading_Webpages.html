  <h1>How To "Hack" Webpages</h1>


  <h3>What is Hacking?</h3>

  <p>
    I feel that a lot of non-technical people or anyone born before 1995 think
    that hacking is the use of esoteric technical knowledge to steal information or
    make machines do things outside of their design. While this is a fiction of Hollywood, they are not
    entirely wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the part of the class where I ask everyone what they
    think hacking is. There's usually a 5 second pause of silence, then 2 or 3 of you raise their hand
    because most of you are either tired or
    don't want to look too eager on the first day.
  </p>

  <p>
    But thankfully, this is an online class, so I'll spare you the ordeal of collaborative
    learning by telling you what it means in this context.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em> Hacking is the use of technincal knowledge to achieve a desired
    outcome. </em>
  </p>

  <h3> Your First Hacking Activity </h3>

  <p>
    Sometimes, I will ask you to download and edit webpages.
    We're going to start by reading the code in this web page.
  </p>

  <p>
  Right-click on this webpage.
  </p>

  <img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/6730059/large_ff3cf6a67ae37c785f2c40758374c4d3.jpg?1586111735?bc=0"
  alt="a cursor on a webpage, with a drop-down menu spilling out of its tail
  the drop-down menu is a box with an array of messages stacked on top of
  eachother. From top to bottom it reads: 'Back', 'Forward', 'Reload', 'Save as...',
  and 'Print...'" >


  <p>
  Select "view webpage"  This should open a
  new tab in your browser. In the new tab, read through the code.
  </p>



  <p>
  There should be a message you can only see inside the code.
  Follow its directions, and go to the next lesson when you are done.

  !~~~ HIDDEN MESSAGE ~~~!

  Holyfuck, (i can't say fuck in class so I'm saying it here)

  You did ! I knew you could. It doesn't even matter how you did it.
  You could have asked a friend to do it or you googled it or you used context
  clues and imitated a fellow classmate.

  The point is, you did something. It doesn't really matter
  how, just that you took the journey unapologetically of form nor circumstance.

  But what does it mean to you? How do you fit into this personally? This is
  what we are going to find out.

  DIRECTIONS :

  1) Go to the canvas course page. Go to the RE: SPECIAL DIRECTIONS discussion
  assignment under the "Webpages, amirite?" Module.

  2) Think about your favourite animal.

  3) Follow the directions below:

  IF YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS A DOG, CAT, BIRD, GERBIL, OR HAMSTER
    POST your FAVOURITE COLOR in the DISCUSSION post.

  IF your favourite animal is NOT a DOG, CAT, GERBIL, or HAMSTER
    POST your FAVOURITE ANIMAL

  ALSO IF you ever wanted to be that at somepoint animal
    POST WHY you wanted to be that animal.

  !!! MYTHICAL CREATURES ARE ALLOWED !!! >:^U

  !~~~ HIDDEN MESSAGE END ~~~!
